## Summary
This repository was created for an undergrad Computational Physics discipline (F 625) [[1]](https://www.dac.unicamp.br/portal/caderno-de-horarios/2022/2/S/G/IFGW/F%20625) at Unicamp.

This project aims to simulate a neural signal of the brain using RC circuits. The main idea is to simulate a capacitor as a cell membrane and the resistors as a potassium channel. 

The project is divided into three parts: building a class to simulate an axon; simulating the signal voltage in function of time; introducing a square signal and observing how it behaves through the RC circuits. The code is based on reference [[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H17YduLAwv4).

## Instructions
To run this repository code, please install all dependencies running the following command on the terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
